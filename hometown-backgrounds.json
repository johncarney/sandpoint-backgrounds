However, a lot of your research has been clandestine as the lost empire has a sinister reputation and many locals feel that these things are best left alone. You have taken to adventuring in the hope that you can make some discoveries that will impress the local scholars, or at least sate your own curiosity.<br>You live independently in a modest home, likely cluttered with books and research materials.
