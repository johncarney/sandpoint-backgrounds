      "description": "Although the official number of Sandpoint's town guards is only about a dozen, another two dozen people help to support the town garrison and the guards themselves. This is more than enough for most days in town, where the most dangerous things one might face on a typical day are a tavern scuffle, a pet stuck on a roof, or a minor public disturbance arising from a trivial altercation between neighbors. But if townsfolk have learned anything from the past two decades, it's that the town's relative peace can be shattered at any moment by goblins, giants, dragons, disasters, murderers, or more!<br>Sandpoint's come to rely on two additional forms of defense as a result, and the first of those is one you've belonged to since you could properly wield a weapon\u2014the Sandpoint Militia. You grew up on Sandpoint's waterfront, perhaps the child of a fisher, sailor, or shipwright, and whether or not your parents approved of your choice to turn away from the sea to join the militia, you know it was the right choice. As a militia member, your duties were to help patrol the city, report suspicious activities, and help to deal with minor events or petty crimes before they have a chance to escalate. Your knack at tricking suspects into revealing their falsehoods, your knowledge about sailing and boats, and your connections on the town's waterfront quickly made you a valued member of the militia whenever help was needed down along the docks\u2014even if this earned you a disparaging nickname or two from petty criminals associated with the Bunyip Club!<br>Whether or not you were involved in a major event over the past several years of your life or if your time as a militia member was relatively unremarkable, you've more recently joined the second line of the town's defense as an adventurer. When things get out of control and exceed the capacity of the town guard to deal with, local adventurers have stepped in to save Sandpoint time and time again and, by joining your group, you stand ready to serve in that capacity the next time ghouls, giants, or worse come to town!<br>As with most militia members, you likely are a lifelong resident of Sandpoint. Whether you still live with your family or have your own place, your home is modest but comfortable\u2014yet you're not against camping out under the stars or spending a night watching from the wall or a rooftop when times require.<br>Choose two ability boosts.

It could be that you've only just arrived in town in the past few weeks, or you might have moved here months or even years ago but have continually struggled to find a place to fit in with the locals. It doesn't help that you've been targeted often by allies of the Scarnetti family with offers of employment, support, or perhaps even friendship. Whether you've accepted these offers, or you've realized that the local aristocrats focus on new arrivals due to their increasingly sour reputation among most of the townsfolk, people have noticed. You haven't done anything yet to annoy the Scarnettis (that they've realized, at least), but many of the locals don't trust you and might even think of you as a Scarnetti snitch or patsy.<br>While your reasons for coming to Sandpoint are up to you, they should have something to do with your curiosity about the town, the Lost Coast, ancient Thassilon, the history of the Varisian lifestyle, or anything that might draw you to the region. You don't yet own your own home in town and aren't sure you ever will, since once you've completed your research you might not intend to stay in Sandpoint. You might have accepted an offer from a Scarnetti ally who had a room to let in their home (or nearby shed), could be paying for a room at one of the town's inns, or might be relying on one of your few non-Scarnetti friends in town for a place to stay. This could be one of your fellow PCs, or it might be someone in town whose place has a small library, such as Veznutt Parooh of The Way North, Brodert Quink (Sandpoint's oldest sage), Jabyl Sorn of the House of Blue Stones, or even Ilsoari Gandethus of Turandarok Academy.<br>Joining this adventuring group may have been a calculated move, a spur-of-the-moment choice, or because someone in the group is an old friend, but it's given you a bit more security and peace of mind. You suspect the decision could sour your reputation with the Scarnettis\u2014but you might not mind!<br>Choose two ability boosts.

      "description": "It seems hard to believe that just 17 years ago, barely anyone knew anything about ancient Thassilon. The towering monoliths and intimidating ruins, such as the immense ruined bridge extending from Magnimar, the strange rune-carved arch over Riddleport, or the partially collapsed tower here in Sandpoint known as the Old Light were sources of countless rumors, but were also held in such suspicious dread that they were rarely explored. When Runelord Karzoug woke from his slumber, though, and a now-legendary band of adventurers explored many Thassilonian ruins during their campaign against him, word of Thassilon spread like wildfire. Adventurers from across the Inner Sea region flocked to Varisia. Whether or not that had a hand in the increasing number of perils rising from old Thassilon or if that was just a coincidence, none can deny that today Thassilon is back, the runelords are either truly dead or returned to life, and the ancient empire's ruins are ripe for research.<br>As a local, you've been equally inspired and intrigued by stories of adventurers who explore these dangerous ruins, be they Sandpoint's own heroes or others who have explored more distant mysteries like Hollow Mountain, the Lady's Light, or Guiltspur. You hope one day to rediscover a Thassilonian ruin that's not yet been fully explored, but you also know that such pursuits are dangerous. Here in Sandpoint, a group called the Runewatchers has dedicated their resources to the research of Thassilon and their runelords, but while you've spoken with them many times, they've yet to fully accept you into their circle. And so you sought out the adventuring party you now belong to. With their aid, you hope to make some discoveries to truly impress the Runewatchers, but also are simply eager to sate your own curiosity about ancient Thassilon and the runelords who once ruled it.<br>Your home in Sandpoint is modest, and likely cluttered with books and research materials or strange ruined objects that could be junk or ancient Thassilonian treasures. Your family might support your passion, or it could be a source of contention that's forced you to seek your own accommodations elsewhere in town. Many villagers look askance at your obsession with forces that have brought peril and ruin to Sandpoint. No matter what you've said to allay their fears, plenty of folks in town worry that you might dig up something that everyone in Sandpoint will come to regret.<br>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.<br>You're trained in the Arcana skill and the Academia Lore skill. You gain the Multilingual skill feat, but one of the languages you gain from this feat must be Thassilonian.<br>Increase the party's reputation with Runewatchers by 1 and reduce the party's reputation with Townsfolk by 1.",

      "description": "There's no denying that the Scarnettis, once one of Sandpoint's most established and successful families, have fallen on hard times. When locals were hired to help rebuild the Scarnetti manor after the giant raid on Sandpoint 17 some years ago, rumors about the family's shady deals with local criminals associated with the Bunyip Club began to spread. While no hard evidence ever came to light, those associated with the Bunyip Club cut ties and Titus Scarnetti had to spend years trying to rebuild the family reputation while also replenishing the family treasury after rebuilding their ostentatious cliffside mansion. With the Varisian Compact coming up for renewal, old wounds have resurfaced as well; people haven't forgotten the actions of Alamon Scarnetti, who nearly destroyed Sandpoint before it was born when he led a drunken raid against local Varisians after diplomatic discussions became strained.<br>Your relationship with the Scarnettis has ensured you're part of all of this, like it or not. You don't bear the family name, but you might be a distant relation from Riddleport or Magnimar hoping for a new chance at life. You could be a petty criminal whose fines were paid by the Scarnettis in return for a promise of service for several months or years. You might even admire the family's tenacity and see in the Scarnettis a chance for your own fortune. The majority of your work for them has either been at one of the family's mills (the Sandpoint Lumber Mill or the Scarnetti Mill), or as one of their agents and \u201cwatchdogs\u201d at another business in town, where you were expected to keep an eye out for rumors and opportunities that the family could benefit from. Your knack at making lies seem like compliments helped you excel in this role, and while the Scarnettis do seem to appreciate your apparent loyalty (or at least the services you've provided in the past), they haven't yet fully embraced you into their circle. Whether that's something you want or seek to escape from, you can't ignore the fact that your reputation as a Scarnetti ally has tarnished your standing with the Sandpoint Cathedral, simply as a side effect of the growing animosity between the two factions.<br>Your home might be with your family, or you could have been staying in a room rented to you at a discount (or perhaps even free of charge) from the Scarnettis, but those accommodations have recently come to an end. Joining this new adventuring group gives you an opportunity to make some of your own money, perhaps get out from under the Scarnettis' shadow, or might even be the leverage you hope to build to finally earn old Titus's approval.<br>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.<br>You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Mercantile Lore skill. You gain the Charming Liar skill feat.<br>Increase the party's reputation with the Scarnetti Consortium by 1 and reduce the party's reputation with the Sandpoint Cathedral by 1.",
