    You grew up in the shadow of your hometown's cathedral, perhaps literally.
    The cathedral's caretaker may be your adoptive parent or religious mentor.
    Regardless of your personal beliefs, the cathedral and it's community have
    been a key part of your life.

    You may live in one of the apartments set aside for acolytes in the
    cathedral itself, or you might have family or own a small house elsewhere in
    town. Whatever the case, you have spent a lot of time in the cathedral
    serving as a scribe.

    Visitors to your Your hometown are often pleasantly surprised to find that
    it has a wide array of shops and services. This is despite the number of
    disasters it has suffered over the past several decades—fires, raids, and
    even tsunamis.

    Growing up in a town with so many businesses, you have never lacked for
    employment opportunities and whether prompted by your parents, or on your
    own, you took an an apprenticeship with a respected local artisan. However,
    lately you have found yourself drawn to the adventuring life. It's not just
    the piles of cash adventurers seem to come across, but the opportunity to
    discover and study strange and occult mysteries.

  description: |-
    you've always been a bit of a troublemaker, instigating pranks and even
    committing minor crimes. Growing up this has caused problems in maintaining
    friendships and has strained relationships with your family. So far your
    quick wits has helped you avoid serious trouble, but lately the town watch
    has taken notice of you. As has one of the local criminal gangs.

    While you might still have family living in town, you are estranged and for
    a while lived on your own in a rented room or abandoned building in one of
    the seedier parts of town using your wits to subsist. Joining a group offer
    adventurers was a natural choice, a way to make money fast, albeit with
    attendant dangers. Your income from adventuring has allowed you to move into
    more stable accommodation and has kept the watch off your back. For now.

- name:   Coastal Local

  description: |-
    Your family has lived in their town for generations. Perhaps they have ties
    to one of the founding families. You have either lived in the same town, or
    have been a frequent visitor from your home elsewhere on the coast. You have
    an abiding fondness for the region: its climate, its terrain, its culture,
    and its history, which stretches back countless generations. At times you
    feel as if you are a fundamental part of the land itself.

    Whether you have lived in your family's town your whole life, or simply been
    a frequent visitor, you have recently made your family's town your base of
    operations for some adventuring activities. You might be living with one off
    your relatives, or perhaps have taken up residence in one of their unused
    properties.

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one

    You're trained in the Society skill and the Hometown Lore skill. You gain

- name:   Militia Member
  traits: [Rare]
  src:    Custom
  description: |-
    Your town has a fairly small complement of town guards, which is adequate to
    deal with the usual minor disturbances amounting to the occasional brawl, or
    boundary dispute, or petty thievery. However, over the past few decades the
    town has seen what locals feel is more than its fair share of graver threats
    in the form of natural disasters, murders, and raids.

    Over the years, the town has come to rely on a militia to support the
    guards. You grew up on the waterfront, perhaps the child of a fisher, or
    sailor, or shipwright. However, instead of following in your parent's
    footsteps, you chose to join the militia. Your duties included patrolling,
    reporting suspicious activities, and helping deal with minor events. Your
    connections to the waterfront made you a valued member of the militia,
    though you have drawn the enmity of one of the local criminal gangs.

    You might have your own modest home, or you might still live with your
    family. However, you are not averse to camping out under the stars or
    spending a night on a watch as duty requires.

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a

    You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Sailing Lore skill. You gain

- name:   Newcomer
  traits: [Rare]

  description: |-
    You are a recent arrival in town, though "recent" depends on your
    perspective. To most locals you are little more than a tourist, though you
    feel you've been here more long enough to put down roots. You have even
    found regular work for one of the founding families, though you are
    beginning to wonder if that may be more of a hindrance in earning the
    trust of the other townsfolk than a help. It seems your benefactors are not
    well-loved by the locals.

    You came to the town for reasons of your own, perhaps because of its
    lifestyle or because of an interest in its history, either recent or
    ancient. You do not own your own home and might be living on modest
    accommodation provided by your employer, or perhaps you are relying on one
    of your few friends in town for a place to stay.

    You have been spending some time in libraries trying to learn a little more
    about the region and whatever it was that drew you here. If that was not
    enough you have also taken to adventuring as a way to make some extra coin
    and perhaps distance yourself from your employers.

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence,
    and one is a free ability boost.

    You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Library Lore skill. You gain
    the Additional Lore skill feat—the lore you choose represents the interest
    and focus of study that drew you to the region.

- name:   Runelord Scholar
  traits: [Rare]

  description: |-
    It seems hard to believe that just 17 years ago, barely anyone knew
    anything about ancient Thassilon. The towering monoliths and intimidating
    ruins, such as the immense ruined bridge extending from Magnimar, the
    strange rune-carved arch over Riddleport, or the partially collapsed tower
    here in Sandpoint known as the Old Light were sources of countless rumors,
    but were also held in such suspicious dread that they were rarely
    explored. When Runelord Karzoug woke from his slumber, though, and a
    now-legendary band of adventurers explored many Thassilonian ruins during
    their campaign against him, word of Thassilon spread like wildfire.
    Adventurers from across the Inner Sea region flocked to Varisia. Whether
    or not that had a hand in the increasing number of perils rising from old
    Thassilon or if that was just a coincidence, none can deny that today
    Thassilon is back, the runelords are either truly dead or returned to
    life, and the ancient empire's ruins are ripe for research.

    As a local, you've been equally inspired and intrigued by stories of
    adventurers who explore these dangerous ruins, be they Sandpoint's own
    heroes or others who have explored more distant mysteries like Hollow
    Mountain, the Lady's Light, or Guiltspur. You hope one day to rediscover a
    Thassilonian ruin that's not yet been fully explored, but you also know
    that such pursuits are dangerous. Here in Sandpoint, a group called the
    Runewatchers has dedicated their resources to the research of Thassilon
    and their runelords, but while you've spoken with them many times, they've
    yet to fully accept you into their circle. And so you sought out the
    adventuring party you now belong to. With their aid, you hope to make some
    discoveries to truly impress the Runewatchers, but also are simply eager
    to sate your own curiosity about ancient Thassilon and the runelords who
    once ruled it.

    Your home in Sandpoint is modest, and likely cluttered with books and
    research materials or strange ruined objects that could be junk or ancient
    Thassilonian treasures. Your family might support your passion, or it
    could be a source of contention that's forced you to seek your own
    accommodations elsewhere in town. Many villagers look askance at your
    obsession with forces that have brought peril and ruin to Sandpoint. No
    matter what you've said to allay their fears, plenty of folks in town
    worry that you might dig up something that everyone in Sandpoint will come
    to regret.

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and
    one is a free ability boost.

    You're trained in the Arcana skill and the Academia Lore skill. You gain
    the Multilingual skill feat, but one of the languages you gain from this
    feat must be Thassilonian.

    Increase the party's reputation with Runewatchers by 1 and reduce the
    party's reputation with Townsfolk by 1.

- name:   Scarnetti-Connected
  traits: [Rare]
  src:    Seven Dooms for Sandpoint Player's Guide
  description: |-
    There's no denying that the Scarnettis, once one of Sandpoint's most
    established and successful families, have fallen on hard times. When
    locals were hired to help rebuild the Scarnetti manor after the giant raid
    on Sandpoint 17 some years ago, rumors about the family's shady deals with
    local criminals associated with the Bunyip Club began to spread. While no
    hard evidence ever came to light, those associated with the Bunyip Club
    cut ties and Titus Scarnetti had to spend years trying to rebuild the
    family reputation while also replenishing the family treasury after
    rebuilding their ostentatious cliffside mansion. With the Varisian Compact
    coming up for renewal, old wounds have resurfaced as well; people haven't
    forgotten the actions of Alamon Scarnetti, who nearly destroyed Sandpoint
    before it was born when he led a drunken raid against local Varisians
    after diplomatic discussions became strained.

    Your relationship with the Scarnettis has ensured you're part of all of
    this, like it or not. You don't bear the family name, but you might be a
    distant relation from Riddleport or Magnimar hoping for a new chance at
    life. You could be a petty criminal whose fines were paid by the
    Scarnettis in return for a promise of service for several months or years.
    You might even admire the family's tenacity and see in the Scarnettis a
    chance for your own fortune. The majority of your work for them has either
    been at one of the family's mills (the Sandpoint Lumber Mill or the
    Scarnetti Mill), or as one of their agents and “watchdogs” at another
    business in town, where you were expected to keep an eye out for rumors
    and opportunities that the family could benefit from. Your knack at making
    lies seem like compliments helped you excel in this role, and while the
    Scarnettis do seem to appreciate your apparent loyalty (or at least the
    services you've provided in the past), they haven't yet fully embraced you
    into their circle. Whether that's something you want or seek to escape
    from, you can't ignore the fact that your reputation as a Scarnetti ally
    has tarnished your standing with the Sandpoint Cathedral, simply as a side
    effect of the growing animosity between the two factions.

    Your home might be with your family, or you could have been staying in a
    room rented to you at a discount (or perhaps even free of charge) from the
    Scarnettis, but those accommodations have recently come to an end. Joining
    this new adventuring group gives you an opportunity to make some of your
    own money, perhaps get out from under the Scarnettis' shadow, or might
    even be the leverage you hope to build to finally earn old Titus's
    approval.

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Dexterity, and one
    is a free ability boost.

    You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Mercantile Lore skill.
    You gain the Charming Liar skill feat.
