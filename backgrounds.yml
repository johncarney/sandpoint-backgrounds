    You grew up in the shadow of your hometown's cathedral, perhaps literally.
    The cathedral's caretaker may be your adoptive parent or religious mentor.
    Regardless of your personal beliefs, the cathedral and it's community have
    been a key part of your life.

    You may live in one of the apartments set aside for acolytes in the
    cathedral itself, or you might have family or own a small house elsewhere in
    town. Whatever the case, you have spent a lot of time in the cathedral
    serving as a scribe.

    Visitors to your hometown are often pleasantly surprised to find that it has
    a wide array of shops and services. This is despite the number of disasters
    it has suffered over the past several decades—fires, raids, and even
    tsunamis.

    Growing up in a town with so many businesses, you have never lacked for
    employment opportunities. Whether prompted by your parents, or of your own
    volition, you took an an apprenticeship with a respected local artisan.
    However, lately you have found yourself drawn to the adventuring life. It's
    not just the piles of cash adventurers seem to come across, but the
    opportunity to discover and study strange and occult mysteries.

    you've always been a bit of a troublemaker, instigating pranks and even
    committing minor crimes. Growing up this has caused problems in maintaining
    friendships and has strained relationships with your family. So far your
    quick wits has helped you avoid serious trouble, but lately the town watch
    has taken notice of you. As has one of the local criminal gangs.

    While you might still have family living in town, you are estranged and for
    a while lived on your own in a rented room or abandoned building in one of
    the seedier parts of town using your wits to subsist. Joining a group offer
    adventurers was a natural choice, a way to make money fast, albeit with
    attendant dangers. Your income from adventuring has allowed you to move into
    more stable accommodation and has kept the watch off your back. For now.

    Your family has lived in their town for generations. Perhaps they have ties
    to one of the founding families. You have either lived in the same town, or
    have been a frequent visitor from your home elsewhere on the coast. You have
    an abiding fondness for the region: its climate, its terrain, its culture,
    and its history, which stretches back countless generations. At times you
    feel as if you are a fundamental part of the land itself.

    Whether you have lived in your family's town your whole life, or simply been
    a frequent visitor, you have recently made your family's town your base of
    operations for some adventuring activities. You might be living with one off
    your relatives, or perhaps have taken up residence in one of their unused
    properties.

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one
    is a free ability boost.

    You're trained in the Society skill and the Hometown Lore skill. You gain
    the Hobnobber skill feat.

- name:   Militia Member
  traits: [Rare]

  description: |-
    Your town has a fairly small complement of town guards, which is adequate to
    deal with the usual minor disturbances amounting to the occasional brawl, or
    boundary dispute, or petty thievery. However, over the past few decades the
    town has seen what locals feel is more than its fair share of graver threats
    in the form of natural disasters, murders, and raids.

    Over the years, the town has come to rely on a militia to support the
    guards. You grew up on the waterfront, perhaps the child of a fisher, or
    sailor, or shipwright. However, instead of following in your parent's
    footsteps, you chose to join the militia. Your duties included patrolling,
    reporting suspicious activities, and helping deal with minor events. Your
    connections to the waterfront made you a valued member of the militia,
    though you have drawn the enmity of one of the local criminal gangs.

    You might have your own modest home, or you might still live with your
    family. However, you are not averse to camping out under the stars or
    spending a night on a watch as duty requires.

    You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Sailing Lore skill. You gain

  description: |-
    You are a recent arrival in town, though "recent" depends on your
    perspective. To most locals you are little more than a tourist, though you
    feel you've been here more long enough to put down roots. You have even
    found regular work for one of the founding families, though you are
    beginning to wonder if that may be more of a hindrance in earning the
    trust of the other townsfolk than a help. It seems your benefactors are not
    well-loved by the locals.

    You came to the town for reasons of your own, perhaps because of its
    lifestyle or because of an interest in its history, either recent or
    ancient. You do not own your own home and might be living on modest
    accommodation provided by your employer, or perhaps you are relying on one
    of your few friends in town for a place to stay.

    You have been spending some time in libraries trying to learn a little more
    about the region and whatever it was that drew you here. If that was not
    enough you have also taken to adventuring as a way to make some extra coin
    and perhaps distance yourself from your employers.

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence,
    and one is a free ability boost.

    You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Library Lore skill. You gain
    the Additional Lore skill feat—the lore you choose represents the interest
    and focus of study that drew you to the region.

- name:   Student of Ancient History
  traits: [Rare]

    It seems difficult to believe that just two decades ago, hardly anyone knew
    of the ancient history of your hometown and its environs. Very few locals
    knew anything about the gargantuan, rune-carved ruins dotting the coast, and
    even their existence was almost unknown outside the region. Events over the
    past couple of decades have changed all that, with an almost feverish
    interest from scholars from near and far in the ancient empire that once
    flourished in this region.

    As a local growing up in the shadow of a ruined tower now known to be a
    relic of this lost empire, you have long been fascinated by this history.
    You hope one day to discover some new ruin that has not been studied, or
    even just visit some of the more famous sites that you have so far only read
    about in books, or heard about from one of the few locals who specialize in
    these studies. However, a lot of your research has been clandestine as
    the lost empire has a sinister reputation and many locals feel that these
    things are best left alone. You have taken to adventuring in the hope that
    you can make some discoveries that will impress the local scholars, or at
    least sate your own curiosity.

    You live independently in a modest home, likely cluttered with books and
    research materials. Your parents might have helped you secure this
    accommodation so you could continue your research in piece, or perhaps your
    studies were a bone of contention that led you to seek your own lodgings.

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and
    one is a free ability boost.

    You're trained in the Arcana skill and the Academia Lore skill. You gain
    the Multilingual skill feat, but one of the languages you gain from this
    feat must belong to the ancient empire that once occupied this region.

    In recent decades, one of the most prominent founding families of your home
    town has faced significant setbacks, stemming largely from rumors of
    dealings with certain local criminals. Despite efforts to restore their
    reputation and finances following the reconstruction of their mansion after
    a past attack, challenges persist. With historical tensions resurfacing due
    to an impending regional political realignment, the family's past actions,
    notably those of a certain individual, continue to haunt them.

    Your association with this family, whether as a distant relative or a
    recipient of their support, intertwines you with their affairs. Your role
    has often involved monitoring rumors and opportunities beneficial to the
    family, leveraging your talent for diplomacy. Despite your contributions,
    full acceptance into their inner circle remains elusive, complicating your
    relationships with the larger community.

    Recent changes in your living arrangements signal a shift, prompting your
    involvement with a new adventuring group. This presents an opportunity to
    pursue personal gain, distance yourself from the family's influence, or
    potentially earn their favor through newfound achievements.

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Dexterity, and one is
    a free ability boost.

    You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Mercantile Lore skill. You
    gain the Charming Liar skill feat.
