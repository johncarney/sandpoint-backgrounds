    You grew up in the shadow of your hometown's cathedral, perhaps literally.
    The cathedral's caretaker may be your adoptive parent or religious mentor.
    Regardless of your personal beliefs, the cathedral and it's community have
    been a key part of your life.

    You may live in one of the apartments set aside for acolytes in the
    cathedral itself, or you might have family or own a small house elsewhere in
    town. Whatever the case, you have spent a lot of time in the cathedral
    serving as a scribe.

    Visitors to your Your hometown are often pleasantly surprised to find that
    it has a wide array of shops and services. This is despite the number of
    disasters it has suffered over the past several decades—fires, raids, and
    even tsunamis.

    Growing up in a town with so many businesses, you have never lacked for
    employment opportunities and whether prompted by your parents, or on your
    own, you took an an apprenticeship with a respected local artisan. However,
    lately you have found yourself drawn to the adventuring life. It's not just
    the piles of cash adventurers seem to come across, but the opportunity to
    discover and study strange and occult mysteries.

    you've always been a bit of a troublemaker, instigating pranks and even
    committing minor crimes. Growing up this has caused problems in maintaining
    friendships and has strained relationships with your family. So far your
    quick wits has helped you avoid serious trouble, but lately the town watch
    has taken notice of you. As has one of the local criminal gangs.

    While you might still have family living in town, you are estranged and for
    a while lived on your own in a rented room or abandoned building in one of
    the seedier parts of town using your wits to subsist. Joining a group offer
    adventurers was a natural choice, a way to make money fast, albeit with
    attendant dangers. Your income from adventuring has allowed you to move into
    more stable accommodation and has kept the watch off your back. For now.

    Your family has lived in their town for generations. Perhaps they have ties
    to one of the founding families. You have either lived in the same town, or
    have been a frequent visitor from your home elsewhere on the coast. You have
    an abiding fondness for the region: its climate, its terrain, its culture,
    and its history, which stretches back countless generations. At times you
    feel as if you are a fundamental part of the land itself.

    Whether you have lived in your family's town your whole life, or simply been
    a frequent visitor, you have recently made your family's town your base of
    operations for some adventuring activities. You might be living with one off
    your relatives, or perhaps have taken up residence in one of their unused
    properties.

    Although the official number of Sandpoint's town guards is only about a
    dozen, another two dozen people help to support the town garrison and the
    guards themselves. This is more than enough for most days in town, where
    the most dangerous things one might face on a typical day are a tavern
    scuffle, a pet stuck on a roof, or a minor public disturbance arising from
    a trivial altercation between neighbors. But if townsfolk have learned
    anything from the past two decades, it's that the town's relative peace
    can be shattered at any moment by goblins, giants, dragons, disasters,
    murderers, or more!

    Sandpoint's come to rely on two additional forms of
    defense as a result, and the first of those is one you've belonged to
    since you could properly wield a weapon—the Sandpoint Militia. You grew up
    on Sandpoint's waterfront, perhaps the child of a fisher, sailor, or
    shipwright, and whether or not your parents approved of your choice to
    turn away from the sea to join the militia, you know it was the right
    choice. As a militia member, your duties were to help patrol the city,
    report suspicious activities, and help to deal with minor events or petty
    crimes before they have a chance to escalate. Your knack at tricking
    suspects into revealing their falsehoods, your knowledge about sailing and
    boats, and your connections on the town's waterfront quickly made you a
    valued member of the militia whenever help was needed down along the
    docks—even if this earned you a disparaging nickname or two from petty
    criminals associated with the Bunyip Club!

    Whether or not you were
    involved in a major event over the past several years of your life or if
    your time as a militia member was relatively unremarkable, you've more
    recently joined the second line of the town's defense as an adventurer.
    When things get out of control and exceed the capacity of the town guard
    to deal with, local adventurers have stepped in to save Sandpoint time and
    time again and, by joining your group, you stand ready to serve in that
    capacity the next time ghouls, giants, or worse come to town!

    As with
    most militia members, you likely are a lifelong resident of Sandpoint.
    Whether you still live with your family or have your own place, your home
    is modest but comfortable—yet you're not against camping out under the
    stars or spending a night watching from the wall or a rooftop when times
    require.

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a
    free ability boost.

    You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Sailing Lore skill. You gain
    the Lie to Me skill feat.

    You've only been in Sandpoint a short time, although what constitutes a
    “short time” depends on who you talk to. It could be that you've only just
    arrived in town in the past few weeks, or you might have moved here months
    or even years ago but have continually struggled to find a place to fit in
    with the locals. It doesn't help that you've been targeted often by allies
    of the Scarnetti family with offers of employment, support, or perhaps
    even friendship. Whether you've accepted these offers, or you've realized
    that the local aristocrats focus on new arrivals due to their increasingly
    sour reputation among most of the townsfolk, people have noticed. You
    haven't done anything yet to annoy the Scarnettis (that they've realized,
    at least), but many of the locals don't trust you and might even think of
    you as a Scarnetti snitch or patsy.

    While your reasons for coming to Sandpoint are up to you, they should have
    something to do with your curiosity about the town, the Lost Coast,
    ancient Thassilon, the history of the Varisian lifestyle, or anything that
    might draw you to the region. You don't yet own your own home in town and
    aren't sure you ever will, since once you've completed your research you
    might not intend to stay in Sandpoint. You might have accepted an offer
    from a Scarnetti ally who had a room to let in their home (or nearby
    shed), could be paying for a room at one of the town's inns, or might be
    relying on one of your few non-Scarnetti friends in town for a place to
    stay. This could be one of your fellow PCs, or it might be someone in town
    whose place has a small library, such as Veznutt Parooh of The Way North,
    Brodert Quink (Sandpoint's oldest sage), Jabyl Sorn of the House of Blue
    Stones, or even Ilsoari Gandethus of Turandarok Academy.

    Joining this adventuring group may have been a calculated move, a
    spur-of-the-moment choice, or because someone in the group is an old
    friend, but it's given you a bit more security and peace of mind. You
    suspect the decision could sour your reputation with the Scarnettis—but
    you might not mind!

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence,
    and one is a free ability boost.

    You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Library Lore skill. You gain
    the Additional Lore skill feat—the lore you choose represents the interest
    and focus of study that drew you to the region.

    It seems hard to believe that just 17 years ago, barely anyone knew
    anything about ancient Thassilon. The towering monoliths and intimidating
    ruins, such as the immense ruined bridge extending from Magnimar, the
    strange rune-carved arch over Riddleport, or the partially collapsed tower
    here in Sandpoint known as the Old Light were sources of countless rumors,
    but were also held in such suspicious dread that they were rarely
    explored. When Runelord Karzoug woke from his slumber, though, and a
    now-legendary band of adventurers explored many Thassilonian ruins during
    their campaign against him, word of Thassilon spread like wildfire.
    Adventurers from across the Inner Sea region flocked to Varisia. Whether
    or not that had a hand in the increasing number of perils rising from old
    Thassilon or if that was just a coincidence, none can deny that today
    Thassilon is back, the runelords are either truly dead or returned to
    life, and the ancient empire's ruins are ripe for research.

    As a local, you've been equally inspired and intrigued by stories of
    adventurers who explore these dangerous ruins, be they Sandpoint's own
    heroes or others who have explored more distant mysteries like Hollow
    Mountain, the Lady's Light, or Guiltspur. You hope one day to rediscover a
    Thassilonian ruin that's not yet been fully explored, but you also know
    that such pursuits are dangerous. Here in Sandpoint, a group called the
    Runewatchers has dedicated their resources to the research of Thassilon
    and their runelords, but while you've spoken with them many times, they've
    yet to fully accept you into their circle. And so you sought out the
    adventuring party you now belong to. With their aid, you hope to make some
    discoveries to truly impress the Runewatchers, but also are simply eager
    to sate your own curiosity about ancient Thassilon and the runelords who
    once ruled it.

    Your home in Sandpoint is modest, and likely cluttered with books and
    research materials or strange ruined objects that could be junk or ancient
    Thassilonian treasures. Your family might support your passion, or it
    could be a source of contention that's forced you to seek your own
    accommodations elsewhere in town. Many villagers look askance at your
    obsession with forces that have brought peril and ruin to Sandpoint. No
    matter what you've said to allay their fears, plenty of folks in town
    worry that you might dig up something that everyone in Sandpoint will come
    to regret.

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and

    You're trained in the Arcana skill and the Academia Lore skill. You gain
    the Multilingual skill feat, but one of the languages you gain from this
    feat must be Thassilonian.

    There's no denying that the Scarnettis, once one of Sandpoint's most
    established and successful families, have fallen on hard times. When
    locals were hired to help rebuild the Scarnetti manor after the giant raid
    on Sandpoint 17 some years ago, rumors about the family's shady deals with
    local criminals associated with the Bunyip Club began to spread. While no
    hard evidence ever came to light, those associated with the Bunyip Club
    cut ties and Titus Scarnetti had to spend years trying to rebuild the
    family reputation while also replenishing the family treasury after
    rebuilding their ostentatious cliffside mansion. With the Varisian Compact
    coming up for renewal, old wounds have resurfaced as well; people haven't
    forgotten the actions of Alamon Scarnetti, who nearly destroyed Sandpoint
    before it was born when he led a drunken raid against local Varisians
    after diplomatic discussions became strained.

    Your relationship with the Scarnettis has ensured you're part of all of
    this, like it or not. You don't bear the family name, but you might be a
    distant relation from Riddleport or Magnimar hoping for a new chance at
    life. You could be a petty criminal whose fines were paid by the
    Scarnettis in return for a promise of service for several months or years.
    You might even admire the family's tenacity and see in the Scarnettis a
    chance for your own fortune. The majority of your work for them has either
    been at one of the family's mills (the Sandpoint Lumber Mill or the
    Scarnetti Mill), or as one of their agents and “watchdogs” at another
    business in town, where you were expected to keep an eye out for rumors
    and opportunities that the family could benefit from. Your knack at making
    lies seem like compliments helped you excel in this role, and while the
    Scarnettis do seem to appreciate your apparent loyalty (or at least the
    services you've provided in the past), they haven't yet fully embraced you
    into their circle. Whether that's something you want or seek to escape
    from, you can't ignore the fact that your reputation as a Scarnetti ally
    has tarnished your standing with the Sandpoint Cathedral, simply as a side
    effect of the growing animosity between the two factions.

    Your home might be with your family, or you could have been staying in a
    room rented to you at a discount (or perhaps even free of charge) from the
    Scarnettis, but those accommodations have recently come to an end. Joining
    this new adventuring group gives you an opportunity to make some of your
    own money, perhaps get out from under the Scarnettis' shadow, or might
    even be the leverage you hope to build to finally earn old Titus's
    approval.

    Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Dexterity, and one
    is a free ability boost.

    You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Mercantile Lore skill.
    You gain the Charming Liar skill feat.
